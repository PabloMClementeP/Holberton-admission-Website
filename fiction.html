                        <h3>Snow Crash</h3>
                        <p>Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash published in 1992 introduces the Metaverse which appears to its users as an urban environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs the entire 65536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.

                        Users of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from grainy black and white public terminals in booths. Stephenson describes a sub-culture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse; they are given the sobriquet "gargoyles" due to their grotesque appearance. The users of the Metaverse experience it from a first person perspective.
            
                        Within the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, "to prevent people from walking around a mile high". Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 Express Ports, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and Local Ports, one kilometer apart.</p>

                        <h3>Ready Player One</h3>
                        <p>Ready Player One, a 2011 science fiction novel by Ernest Cline, depicts a 2045 world gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for most people is a metaverse called the OASIS, which is accessed with a VR headset and wired gloves. It functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual society. A sequel entitled Ready Player Two was released in 2020.

                        A film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg was released in 2018. </p>
